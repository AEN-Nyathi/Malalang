                Malalang Pty Ltd was born from a simple observation: local businesses in Phalaborwa needed a better way to get online. Founder Abram Ntsako saw entrepreneurs being underserved by expensive, complicated web solutions. He decided to create a studio that operated differently.
              </p>
              <p>
                The name "Malalang" comes from the Sepedi word for thatching reed. It symbolizes our approach: using local understanding and foundational strength to build something protective and essential for your businessâ€”your online home.
              </p>
               <p>
                Our model is built on trust and a shared goal: your complete satisfaction.
