        question: "Why don't you require a deposit?",
        answer: "Our 'no deposit' policy is the foundation of our business. We believe in building trust first. We're confident in the quality of our work and want to remove any financial risk for you, our client. You only pay when you are 100% happy with the website."

        question: "How long does it take to build a website?",
        answer: "A standard 5-page website typically takes 1 to 2 weeks from our initial meeting to launch. E-commerce sites or more complex projects may take longer. We'll provide a clear timeline in our proposal."

    {
        question: "Do I need to buy a domain and hosting first?",
        answer: "No, you don't need to worry about that initially. We develop your site on a private staging link. You will only need to purchase your domain name (e.g., yourbusiness.com) right before we launch the site. We can guide you through this process and handle the technical setup for you."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens after the website is launched?",
        answer: "Once launched, the website is fully yours. We transfer all ownership and access to you. We then recommend our 'Complete Launch Pack' to boost your new site's visibility, and our affordable 'Web Care Plan' for ongoing maintenance, security, and support."
